# Competitive-Programming
Archive of my submissions to competitive programming problems.

## Organization
Each programm either has a *title* (e.g. "carrots.cpp") or a *number* (e.g. "11547.cpp") as its file name:

- Titles represent solutions for problems available at [UVa Online Judge](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php)
- Numbers represent solutions for problems available at [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/)
